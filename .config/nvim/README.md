# Neovim Setup

This setup is based on the **Lazy Vim** distro setup for Neovim.

For language specific plugins, check out `/lua/plugins/lang`.

Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.

For a minimal config, run the following:
`nvim -u ~/dotfiles/.config/nvim-minimal/`
